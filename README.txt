FEEDBACK -

After completing your playthrough, I have a little form that is entirely optional but EXTREMELY helpful to fill out, as it will really help me make the appropriate changes and fine tuning to the game.

(If you're able to record your screen as you playtest, it is not required but super helpful as well, and I can see exactly how easy or hard certain levels are, and tune things accordingly)
